    <p>"Cooking Converter" - a simple app to convert from one set of cooking units to another. Six different units are supported. Conversion will not work until units have been selected, at which time the boxes will turn from red to gray.</p>
    <p>The big challenge was how to make this efficient. In the end, I decided to convert everything to tsp, the smallest unit supported, and then output the correct number based on the end units desired. This seemed like the most efficient approach.</p>
